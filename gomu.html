            <h1>Gomu Gomu no Mi</h1>
            <p>The Gomu Gomu no Mi is a Paramecia-type Devil Fruit that grants the user a body of rubber. Originally the fruit was called Hito Hito no Mi, Model: Nika and was classified as a Mythical Zoan that allows one to transform into the legendary "Sun God" Nika. Luffy uses various techniques to utilize his rubber powers, one of his most popular techniques is "Gomu Gomu no Pistol" in which luffy throws a punch that is on par with the strength of a pistol. </p>

Luffy bites into his thumb join and blows hard into his bones, which inflates his arm. He is then able to transfer the air through his entire body. When luffy blows tons of air into his body that when all the air is focused on a single limb, they become the size of a giants.</td>
