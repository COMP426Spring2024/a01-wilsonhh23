            <h1>Devil Fruits</h1>
            <p>Devil Fruits are mysterious fruits that are found within the world of One Piece. These fruits grant those who eat them with superhuman powers and the permanent effect of not being able to swim. Each devil fruit is unique and there is no other like it. These fruits are broadly divided into three groups: Zoan - which allows the user to transform into an animal as well as a hybrid human/animal, Logia - grants a user the power to create, control, and transform themselves into a natural element, Paramecia - offers a vast array of strange abilities that do not fit into the other categories.</p>
